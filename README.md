The goal of this model is to predict the next pitch a pitcher will use, based on the historical season data up to that point. Our dataset contains detailed, pitch-by-pitch information such as the pitch count, pitch result, which runners are on which bases, and other relevant game dynamics for each pitch. It covers all pitches from the 2011 MLB season. Multiple factors will be considered, including both the pitchers’ and batters’ current and historical performances. We hypothesize that the following factors influence the prediction of the next pitch, and will use feature engineering for these hypotheses:
